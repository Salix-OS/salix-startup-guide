"If you are still quite new to either Salix, Slackware or even Linux in "
"general, then you should first of all take some time to study Salix Startup "
"Guide, as it is specifically intended to be accessible to newcomers. The "
"desktop link, Salix Online, will bring you to the Salix <ulink "
"url=\"http://www.salixos.org/wiki/index.php/Home\">Homepage</ulink>. You "
"could also use the <ulink "
"url=\"http://webchat.freenode.net/?randomnick=1&amp;channels=salix&amp;prompt=1\">IRC"
" link</ulink> above to be in live communication with members of the "
"community and get instant help if necessary. If you do however, you might "
"want to modify the default qwebircxxx login to something more personal and "
"human readable."

"We hope that the information here will allow you to get Salix up and running"
" fairly straightforwardly, to begin exploring its potential, and above all "
"to use it for what you want to do. Nonetheless, sometimes you may not know "
"how to do something or be able to make it work."

"While Salix aims to be elegant and intuitive, every operating system has its"
" own characteristics, and if you are new to Linux, the sheer fact that it is"
" different means there will inevitably be a process of adaptation (see Linux"
" is <ulink url=\"http://linux.oneandoneis2.org/LNW.htm\">Not "
"Windows</ulink>), even where its very best features are concerned. The only "
"way to climb the learning curve is by trying things out and using them. The "
"more you explore Salix, the quicker you will become familiar with it. "
"However, it is worth emphasising that the default set of applications (they "
"vary depending on the version of Salix you choose, see <xref linkend=\"appe-"
"Startup_Guide-List_of_Applications\" />) include many that have a very "
"similar look and feel to those found on other operating systems, such as the"
" office suite LibreOffice, which offers full compatibility with common file "
"formats."

"Our <ulink "
"url=\"http://www.salixos.org/wiki/index.php?title=Documentation\">Wiki</ulink>"
" and <ulink url=\"http://www.salixos.org/forum/\">Forum</ulink> will be two "
"other important sources of information. The search option of the forum will "
"quickly show you if the question you have in mind has already been posted by"
" a member of the community and if it has been answered. For the same reason,"
" please also search the internet. If you are working on the command line "
"(see <xref linkend=\"sect-Startup_Guide-Salix_Mini_Walkthroughs-"
"Working_with_the_Command_Line_Interface\" />), remember to consult man (and "
"try man salix for a summary of key points specific to this distribution). "
"There are several online forums devoted to Linux, such as <ulink "
"url=\"http://www.linuxquestions.org/\">www.linuxquestions.org</ulink>. It "
"should be noted that each forum has its own subculture, and sometimes "
"explicit posting guidelines. If you post a query to a forum, bear <ulink "
"url=\"http://www.sas.upenn.edu/~haroldfs/dravling/grice.html\">Paul Grice's "
"conversational maxims</ulink> in mind: for instance, be as specific as "
"possible and mention any information you have already found out. To put it "
"another way, remember you are consulting a human community, not an "
"interactive online encyclopedia; it is a conversation, something which can "
"be easily lost sight of online."

"Forums are a concrete example of one of the qualities at the heart of Linux,"
" which is that it is community-based. Rather than being a commercial "
"product, in almost all cases it is developed by enthusiasts collaborating "
"together for the sheer delight of making good software. This community "
"extends out into the users of the distribution on its forums. Even if you "
"just want to use core office, multimedia or network applications "
"productively, over time the power that Linux gives users tends to promote "
"self-reliance and an ability to configure and fix their computer setup "
"independently. The same approach underlies the development of Linux as an "
"operating system Ì¶ where there is room for improvement, someone will dive in"
" and tinker. The cumulative result is that Linux today is highly usable out "
"of the box."

"The best way to learn Linux is by using it to the full, finding out in the "
"process how to make it do exactly what you want. After a while, though, it "
"may be helpful to supplement this experience with some more systematic "
"background. As mentioned in the section introducing the command line, the "
"<ulink "
"url=\"http://www.salixos.org/forum/viewforum.php?f=30&amp;sid=8007ff0fe74d8ba139ecb29032db24d2\">Documentation</ulink>"
" board on the Salix forums contains a useful post on <ulink "
"url=\"http://www.salixos.org/forum/viewtopic.php?f=30&amp;t=852\">tutorials "
"and guides</ulink>. Wherever you find problems recur, it may be worth "
"reading up on the underlying issues over time to gain broader knowledge, "
"especially when it comes to general features of Linux that may be unfamiliar"
" to you, such as file permissions."

"Some users may face problems at the very beginning with peripherals or the "
"network. This can seem daunting if you are also adapting to a different "
"operating system at the same time. Explore the options under Menu/System "
"carefully. If difficulties persist, with judicious use of the information "
"and help in the wiki and forums, you should hopefully get the essentials set"
" up as you wish reasonably quickly; then you will be able to take Linux at "
"your own pace."
