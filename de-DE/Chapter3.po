"Installing applications (which roughly equates to “installing packages” as "
"we say in Linux) is a fundamental part of the Linux experience. "
"Superficially it is just an exercise using package managers such as Gslapt "
"and its command line equivalent, slapt-get, for installing packages created "
"by others. Soon you will start to see some packages you are interested in "
"are not in the common repositories, and you will start creating your own "
"packages. For some, this could be the very first time they see their build "
"scripts working in the terminal, checking for configuration errors and "
"chasing after some missing dependencies to compile a program. Some "
"frustration may hit you initially, but then in good time, you will gather "
"enough experience and as you start to see the inner workings of Linux, you "
"will become more confident."
