How to use this?
- Install the OpenOffice PDF export configuration into your OOo config using the file "ooconfig".
- Install the packages itools and unoconv:
    http://enialis.net/~jrd/salix/itools/
    http://enialis.net/~jrd/salix/unoconv/
- Use "./compile all pdf" to compile all ODT and all PDF too.
  Use "./compile LOCALE pdf" to compile only for this locale.
  Sometimes one locale may crash, in this case just try again. Assure you that there is no OOo instance running.

If you want to update the content of the ODT file:
- Open the ODT file under OOo and make all your modifications.
- Save it to "new.odt".
- Create a folder "new".
- Unzip it to this folder: "cd new && unzip ../new.odt".
- Copy back all file from "new" to "odt" except "Pictures".
- Sync "new/Pictures" with "images/en".
- Run "./fix_grddl.sh" to remove a non-used namespace added by latest OOo not handled by itools yet.
- Run "./update_translations.sh" to update the .pot file and all others .po files.
- Edit the .pot file and check for splitted words/sentances "like th<span class="Toto">is typ</span>e of things" by either removing the wrong tag or by repositionning it correctly in the file odt/content.xml.
- Re-run "./update_translations.sh" until you're satisfied.
- Use "./compile.sh all pdf" to generate all PDF file from this.
