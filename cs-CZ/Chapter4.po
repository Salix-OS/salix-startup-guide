"This section deals with working in a console mode or with a terminal (such "
"as xfce terminal, xterm, konsole and so forth), and serves merely as a light"
" introduction to what we call \"command line interface\" (CLI). The intended"
" audience here is not seasoned travellers but new journeymen in the land of "
"Linux, who are willing to discover more about what one can do with it. We "
"will go through some examples in this section for you to follow, and "
"hopefully by the end of this walkthrough, you will have no problem working "
"in the “black screen”. For those who would like to know more about CLI, "
"there are a couple of useful resources available on the net, and some are "
"listed in the <ulink "

"So why learn CLI commands at all? Graphical user interfaces for applications"
" have been steadily improving in Linux, and are probably now comparable to "
"any OS in their ease of use. On the other hand, where Linux excels in "
"particular is in the area of command line applications, its traditional "
"strength. Without the CLI, you would be effectively missing out on half of "
"what Linux can offer, if not more."

"\"cp\" is perhaps one of the most used commands in a console mode. \"cp\" "

"file or files. For example, if you would like to remove all photos with .jpg"
" extension but not with .png, you can issue a command something like: \"rm "
"*.jpg\". This will remove all the files with .jpg extension within the "
"directory you are in. Note that the \"rm\" command will not ask you to "

"say that you did not like the earlier decision to call the log file "
"\"log.txt\" and you now want to rename it as \"log\" again. Type in \"mv "
"photo/log.txt photo/log\" and execute the command. Now the file name has "

"Ratpoison is a tiling window manager, somewhat like xmonad or scrotwm. Its "
"two main features are that applications fill the whole screen, with no bars "
"or buttons; and the user interface can be controlled entirely from the "
"keyboard, with no mouse. If needed, any number of windows may be shown "
"simultaneously, and rearranged at will - whence the term \"tiling\" WM. All "
"this may take some getting used to, but although - or perhaps because - the "
"interface is so very different from the conventional point-and-click "
"approach, it can quickly become highly intuitive. Learning which actual keys"
" do what takes far less time than might be imagined. Apart from its "
"efficiency and lack of clutter, ratpoison is a good choice for anyone "
"concerned about RSI (cumulative strain from long-term mouse use), or for "
"netbook users, because \"every pixel counts\". It is also highly "
"configurable - and fast!"

"The applications present for the Ratpoison edition aim to fit in with its "
"minimalist (but not spartan) approach. The majority use vim-style "
"keybindings, even though ratpoison itself does not, so users will need to "
"become comfortable with these if they are not already; cheatsheets are "
"available online to help assimilate them, as well as guides (and manpages) "
"for the individual applications. Common operations use only a small subset "
"of keys, which makes the learning curve smoother: for basic browsing, for "
"instance, all you need to get started is page and history navigation and to "
"know how to open links and tabs or windows. Other functions can be learned "
"by exploration at your own pace. To begin using Vim itself, try running "
"vimtutor from a terminal, and just follow the instructions."
